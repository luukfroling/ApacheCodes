# School project

Had to give a presentation about internet security, so i wrote some programs to:
1) c++ program to log the internet activity of the victim, and send all the websites to my RPI.
2) C++ program to save all the incomming data, and safe them to a file
3) A php function to read the file
4) A javascript part to update the website and call the php function (AJAX). used P5.js to remove the img and add text.
5) Basic HTML page, not much.
